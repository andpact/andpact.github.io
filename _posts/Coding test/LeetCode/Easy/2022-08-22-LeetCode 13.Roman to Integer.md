# **13. Roman to Integer**
## **Problem**
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.
```
Symbol      Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```
For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```
**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
- It is **guaranteed** that s is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

## **Solution**

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        dict = {
            "I": 1,
            "V": 5,
            "X": 10,
            "L": 50,
            "C": 100,
            "D": 500,
            "M": 1000
        }
        result = 0
        s = s.replace("IV", "IIII").replace("IX", "VIIII")
        s = s.replace("XL", "XXXX").replace("XC", "LXXXX")
        s = s.replace("CD", "CCCC").replace("CM", "DCCCC")
        for i in s:
            result += dict[i]
        return result
```
## **Key point**
- 문제에서 주어진 Symbol과 Value가 짝을 지어 나열되어있다. -> Key와 Value를 짝짓는 자료구조 dictionary를 생각해 볼 수 있다.
- "IV"를 6이 아닌 4로 계산해야한다. -> "IV"를 "IIII"로 대체, 나머지도 동일
