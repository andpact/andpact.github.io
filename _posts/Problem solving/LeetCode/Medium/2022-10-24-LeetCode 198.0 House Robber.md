## **Problem**
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```
**Constraints:**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 400

## **Solution**
```java
class Solution {
    /* the order is: prev2, prev1, num  */
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0)
        return 0;
        int prev1 = 0;
        int prev2 = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            int tmp = prev1;
            prev1 = Math.max(prev2 + num, prev1);
            prev2 = tmp;
        }
        return prev1;
    }
}
